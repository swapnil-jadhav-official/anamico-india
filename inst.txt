You are an expert frontend developer creating a comprehensive product management dashboard in React.

Your next task is to update the main App component to feature a responsive, two-column layout. This new layout will serve as the main screen for product management, with navigation and tools on the left and the main content area on the right.

Key Requirements:

Layout Structure:

Implement a main container that uses a responsive grid. On large screens (desktops), it should be a three-part grid (lg:grid-cols-3).

Left Column: This column should span one-third of the width on large screens (lg:col-span-1). It will contain the ProductListTools component, which includes the product search, a list of existing products, and tool buttons.

Right Column: This column should span two-thirds of the width on large screens (lg:col-span-2). It will house the main "Add New Product" stepper form that you've already built.

Responsiveness: On smaller screens (tablets and mobile), the columns should stack vertically, with the ProductListTools appearing above the stepper form.

Component Integration:

The main App component should render both the ProductListTools component and the stepper form within this new grid layout.

Ensure there is appropriate spacing (gap) between the columns on larger screens.

Styling:

Continue using Tailwind CSS for all styling.

The overall background of the page should remain a light gray (bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-900) to frame the components.

Both the left and right column components should have a card-like appearance with rounded corners and shadows, consistent with the existing design.

Theme & Tech Consistency: Ensure the new layout seamlessly integrates with the existing technology stack (React, Hooks) and visual theme, maintaining consistency with the current component styling and color palette.
